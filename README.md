# Project Archive

Project Archive is my online representation of work I have created, as well as my skills and experiences. It includes my resume, a video summary of qualifications and skills, images and links of projects, and more. The thought process in making it was to give more people access to your work and a better idea of your abilities as well as display skills and projects in a robust and visual way that complements the information in your resume and cover letter.
